## Installation

This project can be installed simply by cloning the repo.  Navigate to the repo  and click the green code button. You can copy the URL here. Next locate the folder where you would like to create the cloned repo and open a terminal. Use the command "git clone " and then paste the URL and press Enter. This will create a copy of the repo on your machine! Now simply open a terminal at index.js and type "npm i" or "npm install" to install dependencies. Once the dependencies are present, run command "node index.js" in a terminal at index.js (or its parent folder) to start creating your README.

## Usage

This is an open source project with an MIT license. We ask that this README generator be used for open source projects so that we can keep the internet open, free, and accessible to as many as possible! Once you've created a great README, simply move it to your projects root folder and push to your own repo.

## License

No licensing information at this time.

## Contributing

Always grateful for contributions! Send them using the contact information in the Questions section. Right now blank answers are accepted and only 4 license options are available. We may expand this project later on to include more features!

## Tests

Test as you see fit. If you do not remove the README.md from the output folder, the file will be overwritten. Note, if you use this code elsewhere, all .md files in the output folder will be ignored during git pushes due to the gitignore in that folder.
